### Auto enabling location (only 1.1-beta)

The app is able to automatically enabe location if it is off, but you need to grant a specific permission through adb.

To grant the permission you need to do the following:
1. Install ADB (https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html)
2. Activate Developer options on your phone (https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable)
3. In the Developer options enable USB debugging (https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#debugging)
4. Connect your phone with your computer via USB
5. On your computer open a terminal, change to the directory where you extracted the platform tools and run the following command

```
adb shell pm grant com.xfarrow.locatemydevice android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```


## Security
### Security measures in place

This application manages sensitive data. As such, it strives to be as secure as possible. There are two walls to resist a potential malicious individual:
* Password (mandatory): The default password is ```0000```. Change it to something more secure to enhance your protection. Furthermore, you probably know that SMS are not encrypted. This means that it is advised to change your password when you send to your smartphone messages containing it in order to deny access to attackers as soon as possible (unlikely and costly attack, yet let's try to prevent any displeasing scenario).
* Whitelist (optional): Whitelist numbers are the only numbers that the app will accept communications from.

### Legit apks
GitHub's releases section is the only place where I am uploading apks. Packages on F-Droid are compiled by the repo's owner.

### Antivirus' false positives
Some antivirus falsely report it's a malware due to the app's extensive demanding permissions.

## More info
There is already Google Find My Device, but I wanted to develop a free and open source alternative (even tho it is suggested to keep Google's, unless you do not have Play Services and/or wanting to go full-in about privacy). There is already a good FOSS alternative, [Find My Device](https://gitlab.com/Nulide/findmydevice) (from which I took inspiration from), but wanted to change it a little. I did [fork](https://www.github.com/xfarrow/FindMyDevice) it, but eventually decided to create my own project.
